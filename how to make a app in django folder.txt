## how to make a apps in Django folder

1) to make a app in django file you have to write this command in terminal "python ./manage.py startapp appname"
this will create a directory that is app directory

2) after creating app you go inside the app directory and create a directory called templates and insite template you make a directory called same as your appname.
here you store all you html files

3)inside the app directory and you also create a directory called static and insite static you make a directory called same as your appname.
here you store all you static files

4) after this you find a setting.py on your project directory, then inside this  section you find a section called installed app like this

INSTALLED_APPS = [
    'django.contrib.admin',
    'django.contrib.auth',
    'django.contrib.contenttypes',
    'django.contrib.sessions',
    'django.contrib.messages',
    'django.contrib.staticfiles',
    'appname',
]

in this section you write name of your app then.

5) then you find urls.py file where you find setting.py, after open urls.py you want add some code like this

from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path, include

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),

    # for chatting
    path('appname/', include('appname.urls')),
]

6) after that you create a file named urls.py inside the app directory, after creating you want to add the line of code like this

from django.urls import path
from . import views

urlpatterns = [

    # for chatting
    path('', views.index, name='appname index'),
]

# Create your views here.
from django.http import HttpRequest
