## How to set templates on django projects (Templates means a file like html which we have use to show our website design)

follow the steps to set templates on django project :

1) open your project directory and create a directory called templates

2) then open template directory and create index.html

3) after this you have find a file called setting.py on you project folder

4) after finding that file open the file on IDE and in that file you find a section like this

TEMPLATES = [
    {
        'BACKEND': 'django.template.backends.django.DjangoTemplates',
        'DIRS': [],                                                          # here we tell Django that i have a template folder to store html
        'APP_DIRS': True,
        'OPTIONS': {
            'context_processors': [
                'django.template.context_processors.debug',
                'django.template.context_processors.request',
                'django.contrib.auth.context_processors.auth',
                'django.contrib.messages.context_processors.messages',
            ],
        },
    },
]

in this section you find a line like this 

'DIRS' : []

in bracits you have to write a directory name which you have create previously

5) after this you find another file called views.py in project folder

6) open that file on your IDE

7) you have to import render from django.sortcuts, to import that module write this line

# here we import render from django.shortcuts to request template files like html
from django.shortcuts import render

6) after this create a function called home, like this

# givinh content to home page from render 
def home(request):
    info = {'name': 'john', 'address': 'USA'}
    return render(request, 'index.html', info)            # rander takes three argument req,filename,dictonary

7) after creating function you find a file called urls.py and open this file on your IDE

8) after opening add a line in urlpatterns

9) to add line write this

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),                 # this path is for urls of our website

    # in first argument give a path blank means home page
    #  in second we tell to path goes in view.py and find function
    # in third arugument we have given a name to the path

    path('', views.home, name='home'),       # this path goes on view file and find homepage function and show the content 
]

10) after this you hit server and your HTML content will shows in browser.
